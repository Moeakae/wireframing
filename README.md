# wireframing
A crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application
## Wireframe Elements
Wireframes are low-fidelity visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a website or application. They help in planning the layout and functionality before any visual design or development begins.

###  Key Elements of a Wireframe

---

### 1. **Layout Structure**
Defines the overall organization and alignment of components on the page.

 *Example*: In a booking system, the layout might include a sidebar filter on the left and a property listing grid on the right. This allows users to filter and view listings side by side.

 *Contribution*: Ensures consistent user experience across pages and helps prioritize content visually.

---

### 2. **Navigation**
Shows how users move between different sections of the interface.

 *Example*: A top navigation bar with links to Home, Listings, Bookings, Profile, and Logout.

 *Contribution*: Enables smooth and intuitive movement through the application, enhancing usability.

---

### 3. **Content Placement**
Determines where text, images, buttons, and other elements appear on the screen.

 *Example*: On the listing detail page, the property title and images are placed at the top, while pricing and booking form are on the right.

 *Contribution*: Guides users’ attention to important information and actions, improving engagement and clarity.

---

### 4. **Functionality**
Represents interactive elements and how they respond to user input.

 *Example*: A “Book Now” button that triggers a checkout form or modal.

 *Contribution*: Demonstrates how users can interact with the product and what actions are available on each screen.

Wireframes are essential tools during early design and development phases, ensuring clarity, collaboration, and efficiency.
### Types of Wireframes
| Low-fidelity                                                     | High-fidelity wireframes
-Definition: Basic sketches or block diagrams,                     |                                           
-Purpose: Focus on layout, navigation,                             |
 aand core functionality—not visual design.                        |
### Charcteristics:                                                |
-Minimal details (e.g., grey boxes instead of images)              |
-Placeholder text ("Lorem Ipsum")                                  |
-No color or branding                                              |
-When Used: Early in the design process to brainstorm ideas,
 get quick feedback, or align on layout and user flow.

                                                                     |Characteristics:

                                                                    |Includes actual text, images, fonts, and color schemes
                                                                    |Mimics final UI structure and behavior
                                                                    |When Used: Later in the design phase, often before handoff to developers or for stakeholder presentation.
